## Issues with existing api approaches:
- the technologies that allow client-server communication has evolved, the most common being SOAP and REST
- currently most pplications utilise REST dues to the difficulties asssociated learning and understanding SOAP protocol
- REST doesn't impose strict rules on how to implement APIs compared to SOAP
- Difficulties associated with clients specifying exactly what they want from server
